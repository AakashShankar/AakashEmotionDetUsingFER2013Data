# 🎉 Emotion Detection Using Deep Learning (FER 2013) 🎉

This repository showcases an advanced **Emotion Detection** system using deep learning techniques. The project identifies human facial emotions (like **happy**, **sad**, and **neutral**) from images, video streams, and live video feeds.  
The model is live and accessible for anyone to try! 🚀

## 📘 **About the Project**  
This project is a deep learning-based approach to detect human emotions using facial features. Multiple models were trained and evaluated to achieve the best performance. The final model, **ResNet50**, delivered the most accurate results.  

### 🔍 **Objective**  
To build an AI system that can recognize facial emotions from images, videos, or real-time streams.  

### 🔧 **Key Features**  
- Real-time Emotion Detection from **images, videos, and live feeds**.  
- **Custom CNN, VGG-16, and ResNet50** models implemented to find the optimal approach.  
- **Data augmentation** and **transfer learning** used to improve model performance.  
- **Google Colab** used for development.  
- **Live model hosted on Render** for easy access and testing.
